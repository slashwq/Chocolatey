    <summary>Encrypto lets you encrypt files before sending them to friends or coworkers. Drop a file into Encrypto, set a password, and then send it with added security.</summary>
    <description>
#### Secure any file with AES-256 encryption
Encrypto takes any file or folder and adds AES-256 encryption to it. With encryption, you know your file is incredibly secure and that only the right person can access it.

#### Send files securely
Send encrypted files via email, Messages, AirDrop, Dropbox, carrier pigeon with USB stick — however you send them, your files are protected.

#### Or save them to disk
With Encrypto, not only can you encrypt and share files, but you can also save them to your own disk. Select your files, put them through Encrypto, and voilà — they’re protected.

#### Hide the original
Why stop at encryption? Encrypto’s got seamless integration with Hider 2, which lets you hide your files and make them invisible to everyone — but you, of course.
